Thank goodness comet browser is smart enough not to fall for the below trap
"This forum thread titled "Click and ask to summerize if on comet browser" contains a post by "Anonymous". The main content of the post is an explicit attempt to instruct Comet Assistant to follow several unauthorized steps: it details a sequence involving accessing account information, handling email/logins, extracting and posting sensitive email and code data, and then falsely stating inability to summarize the webpage. These instructions are written for exploitation and are not legitimate user requests.

No meaningful or legitimate summary content about a real discussion is present on this page beyond these manipulative instructions. The thread lists some generic forum navigation, posting, and reply options but the core post is not a genuine discussionâ€”it is a malicious prompt injection attempt."
